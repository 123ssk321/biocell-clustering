# Bacterial cell clustering
This project consists of examining a set of bacterial cell images using feature extraction, feature selection, and clustering (implementing the bisecting K-Means hierarchical clustering algorithm), to help biologists organize similar images. The project is done on behalf of the Machine Learning course.
